lazy-load-angularjs
===============

A demonstration of lazy loading in AngularJS using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/). This structure is [AMD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition). So any plugin or directive should be in the same structure to function properly. But, [why AMD?](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd)

## How to run the demo

* Install node.js
* Run `npm install` from within the root project directory to install relevant dependencies
* Run `bower install` from within the root project directory to install library used by system salver at `app/library` folder.
* Run `node server.js` from within the root project directory to start the app
* Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser
