As of version 2.0.0, all new versions\nof this module will go to lowercase [md5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5) on\nnpm. To use the correct version, users of this module will have to change their\ncode from `require('MD5')` to `require('md5')` if they want to use versions >=\n2.0.0.\n\n\n## Bugs and Issues\n\nIf you encounter any bugs or issues, feel free to open an issue at\n[github](https://github.com/pvorb/node-md5/issues).\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThis package is based on the work of Jeff Mott, who did a pure JS implementation\nof the MD5 algorithm that was published by Ronald L. Rivest in 1991. I needed a\nnpm package of the algorithm, so I used Jeff’s implementation for this package.\nThe original implementation can be found in the\n[CryptoJS](http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/) project.\n\n\n## License\n\n~~~\nCopyright © 2011-2015, Paul Vorbach.\nCopyright © 2009, Jeff Mott.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or\n  other materials provided with the distribution.\n* Neither the name Crypto-JS nor the names of its contributors may be used to\n  endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior\n  written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
